My Bloody Valentine,When You Sleep,1991,shoegaze,"When I look at you
Oh, but I don't know what's real
Once in a while
And you make me laugh

And I'll sleep tomorrow
And it won't be long
Won't stand around
Then you take me down
When you walk away

When you say: I do
Oh, but I don't believe you
I can't forget it
No, ooh

When you sleep tomorrow
And it won't be long
Once in a while
When you make me smile
When you turn your long blonde hair

When I look at you
Oh, but I don't know what's real
Once in a while
And you make me laugh

And I'll sleep tomorrow
And it won't be long
Won't stand around
Then you take me down
When you walk away"
My Bloody Valentine,Only Shallow,1991,shoegaze,"Sleep like a pillow
Downward and
Where she won't care
Anyway where

Soft as a pillow
Touch her there
Where she won't dare
Somewhere

Sleep like a royal subject
Think that you grew
Stronger there

Speak your troubles
She's not scared
Soft like there's silk
Everywhere

Sleep is a pillow
Come where she won't dare
Anyway where

Look in the mirror
She's not there
Where she won't care
Somewhere"
My Bloody Valentine,Soon,1990,shoegaze,"Wake up don't fear
I want to love you
Yeah don't go there
I let you get to me
Yeah yeah

Come back don't be afraid of me
Soon that I'll harm you
Your eyes are blue, blue jewels
Yeah yeah

Come back have faith
Someone like you can't find the reason
Of what I did to you
Yeah yeah

Wake up don't fear
I want to love you
Yeah don't go there
I let you get to me
Yeah yeah"
Slowdive,Alison,1993,shoegaze,"Listen close and don't be stoned
I'll be here in the morning
'Cause I'm just floating
Your cigarette still burns
Your messed up world will thrill me
Alison, I'm lost
Alison, I said, ""We're sinking""
There's nothing here, but that's okay
Outside your room, your sister's spinning
But she laughs, tells me she's just fine
I guess she's out there somewhere
And the sailors, they strike poses
TV covered walls, and so slowly
With your talking and your pills
Your messed up life still thrills me
Alison, I'm lost
Alison, I'll drink your wine
And wear your clothes when we're both high
""Alison"", I said, ""We're sinking""
But she laughs and tells me it's just fine
I guess she's out there somewhere"
Slowdive,Souvlaki Space Station,1993,shoegaze,"Closed doors brings open minds (and I don't want to see you)
See you smile inside (and I don't want to know you)
Faces and I've fallen (and I don't want to hear you)
Wonder why I'm here now
In asylum
Don't you see?
In asylum
Don't you see?
Doors close and feelings flow (and I don't want to know you)
Through my mind I feel his (and I don't want to hear you)
Pictures and I've fallen (and I don't want to know you)
Wonder why I'm here now (I promise to be near you)
Curse your soul, I don't wanna hear you
And I, curse your soul, I don't wanna know you
Curse your soul, I don't wanna hear you
And I, curse your soul, I don't wanna know you"
Slowdive,Machine Gun,1993,shoegaze,"See you walking and I know shes my friend, again
Just the weight of the water drags me down, again
Guess I'll think of the water its my friend, oh yea
It's just the way that the water makes me feel again
Son of Sheba I saw him drown
Son of yellow I saw him drown
It's all I need yeah
See you walking and I know shes my friend, again
Just the weight of the water drags me down, again
Guess I'll think of the water its my friend, oh yea
It's just the way that the water makes me feel again
Son of Sheba I saw him drown
Son of yellow I saw him drown
It's all I need yeah"
Ride,Vapour Trail,1990,shoegaze,"First you look so strong then you fade away
The sun will blind my eyes, I love you anyway
Thirsty for your smile, I watch you for a while
You are a vapour trail in a deep blue sky

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la

Tremble with a sigh, glitter in your eye
You seem to come and go, I never seem to know
And all my time is yours as much as mine
We never have enough time to show our love

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la"
Ride,Leave Them All Behind,1992,shoegaze,"Wheels turning around into alien grounds
Pass through different times
Leave them all behind
Leave them all behind
Leave them all behind
Leave them all behind
Leave them all behind
Just to see we've got so far to go
Until we get there, just let it flow
Just let it flow
Just let it flow
Just let it flow
Just let it flow, just let it flow
Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ahh
Colours shining clear
Fading into night
Our grasp is broken
There's nothing we can do
I don't care about the colours
I don't care about the light
I don't care about the truth
I don't care about the truth"
Ride,Dreams Burn Down,1990,shoegaze,"Lying under sky, laughing at everything I say
And pulls me under, there's no time to resist
Lying on the floor, the tears are falling down and more
Her eyes speak loud but actions speak the best
Waiting, hoping for a sign that what's forbidden can be mine
I just want what I can't have 'til my dreams burn down and choke me every time
She's effortlessly cool but circumstances can be cruel
And sometimes you must accept that you can't always get what you want
We fill up our days and nights, we fill up the gaps in our empty little lives
But we know we are doomed, the moment we walk out the room
Waiting, hoping for a sign that what's forbidden can be mine
I just want what I can't have 'til my dreams burn down and choke me every time"
Lush,Sweetness and Light,1990,shoegaze,"See my life (I've been so tired)
See myself (I've been uptight)
See my life (I've been so tired)
See my sight (I could disappear)
See with you
Memories fading fast
And with you
It's never going to last
You are the sweetness in my eyes
You are an apple in disguise
See with you
I never seemed to look the other way
Only to stay, only to breathe, only to see
That space and light is what I really need
You are the sweetness in my eyes
You are an apple in disguise
I never wanted to tell lies
You are the sweetness in my eyes
You are the sweetness in my eyes
You are an apple in disguise
You are the juice I need for life
You are the sweetness in my eyes"
Lush,For Love,1992,shoegaze,"Pretty little girl, she shines
Knowing she is young, she smiles
Happy just to be a prize
Happy just to see his smile
Silly little girl, she tries
Thinking she is good, and wise
Doesn't recognise the lies
Pouring from her lips, she sighs:
This is so real,
It's what I feel,
I look in your eyes and lose myself
Silly little girl denies
Every understanding why
Her face is full of sad surprise
Every time she hears him cry:
What do you feel
When you're with me?
I look in your eyes and see myself
But there's no connection,
Just his own reflection
Isn't this the way you wanted me?
(what do you mean?)
In love with you
(what do I feel?)
Do anything
(what do you mean?)
For you
She looked in his eyes to lose herself
And when it falls apart, she cries
Doesn't think to look inside
She just covers up her eyes
Doesn't see her own disguise
And though she feels this sorrow,
It will fade tomorrow
She'll pretend that this was really love
(what do you mean?)
She'll make their fall
(what did I feel?)
Seem beautiful
(what do you mean?)
She won't remember this at all
(what do you mean?)
She won't recall
(what did I feel?)
The truth at all
(what do you mean?)
She wants to fall
(what did I feel?)
Again
(what do you mean?)"
Lush,De-Luxe,1990,shoegaze,"I've been waiting on the slide
Suggest I open wide
No incentive to hide
Happy coursing through my veins
Don't even know my name
When I'm up you're coming down
Inside of me, some sight to see
Some sight to feel our earthy bed
When we're wrapped in polythene
What's that supposed to mean
Paper flowers bring me luck
No birds in sight I fear
Stick sticks in you my dear
When I'm up you're coming down
Some say I'm vague
And I'd easily fade
Foolish parade of fantasy
Drink in your eyes
Drink in you sighs
Grass in my thighs my aching legs"
Chapterhouse,Pearl,1991,shoegaze,"Circle of color
Beautiful girl
Daughter of yellow
Mother of pearl
I used to know her
She gave me the time
Then she just left me
I thought she was mine
On my mind, liquid pearl
Coolest blue, fire world
But I can't seem to
Change her mind
Son of a secret
Sacred child
Daughter of yellow
Mother of pearl
She used to love me
I gave her my soul
Those delicate hours
She lost control
On my mind, liquid pearl
Coolest blue, fire world
But I can't seem to
Change her mind
Son of a pearl
Green deep sea
She knows what she means to me
Will her heart ever burn anymore
Burn me out from the inside
Turn me upside down
I've got to satisfy my soul
Satisfy my soul"
Chapterhouse,Breather,1991,shoegaze,"Please me, make me happy
Breather, sleeper
Make me happy
Misty, crystal
Blister, eternal
Soft and liquid in the light
Secret otherworldly sight
Passing time in black and white
If only I could dream tonight
On my own
Teenage lessons set me right
Taught me how to dream tonight
Love me warm in cold daylight
Soft as skin and safe inside
Smother silky sin so fine
Make believe that you are mine
On my own
Tears and sorrow set me right
Taught me how to dream tonight"
Chapterhouse,Something More,1991,shoegaze,"Crystal light in deep blue eyes
Weren't enough to satisfy
Senses reeling off the floor
But I always wanted something more
You're not alone
Had to tell you how I felt
Had to try with someone else
Breathless nights or burning sun
Waking tears, you weren't the one
You're not alone
Pick me off the floor"
Cocteau Twins,Cherry-Coloured Funk,1990,shoegaze,"Beetles and eggs and blues and pour a little everything else
You steam a lens stable eyes and glass
Not get pissed off through my bird lips as good news
Still we can find our love down from behind
Down far behind this fabulous, my turn rules

Beetles and eggs and blues and bells and eggs and then blued
Beetles and eggs and blues and pour a little everything else

You steam a lens stable eyes and glass
Not get pissed off through my bird lips as good news
You'll hang the hearts black and dull as the night
We hanged your pass and start being as you in ecstasy

Still being cried and laughed at before
Should I be sewn in hugged I can by not saying
Still being cried and laughed at from light to blue
And should I be hugged and tugged down through this tiger's masque
And should I be sung and unbroken by not saying
You mind not saying
He'll hang that heart's black and dull as the night

Still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from gains
We hanged your pass and star being as you in ecstasy
Still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from gains
Should I be sung and unbroken by not saying
Still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from gains
Hugged and tugged down through this tiger's masque for key"
Cocteau Twins,Heaven or Las Vegas,1990,shoegaze,"Who'll ever win?
Gee, you're just so ephemeral
Go back for new
For new in vain, it failed

Singing on the famous street
I want to love a boy that won't love me
Am I just in heaven or Las Vegas
That's why it is more brighter than the sun is to me

He's a hustler
It's a role, he'll never make a suit
Hang on to this
So stay and spin and fail and fail
Who'll ever win?
Gee, you're just so ephemeral
Go back for new
For new in vain, it failed

Singing on the famous street
I want to love a boy that won't love me
Am I just in heaven or Las Vegas
That's why it is more brighter than the sun is to me
Reaching this itch in my soul
That's like any old playing card
It must be why I'm thinking of Las Vegas
Why it's more brighter than the sun is to me

Furthermore, let's blast it off
I'm dizzy so I go under the Big Dipper
Come fantasy for a carnival
I'm empty before our wedding

Singing on the famous street
I want to love a boy that won't love me
Am I just in heaven or Las Vegas
That's why it is more brighter than the sun is to me
Reaching this itch in my soul
That's like any old playing card
It must be why I'm thinking of Las Vegas
Why it's more brighter than the sun is to me

Maybe there, while you was rail
I'll go in and seize your heart and be personal
I suspect I'm singing to you a tune
And still you find the beat and sing it to you soon"

Swervedriver,Duel,1993,shoegaze,"You've been away for so long
You can't ask why
You've been away
You can't ask why
You can't ask why
A million stars out tonight
Could spark neon from candlelight
One million stars
Could spark neon from candlelight
Could spark neon from candlelight
I'm goin' down, down to the market place
Goin' to learn to give
I'm goin' down, down by the sea market side
Goin' to learn to live
The tightropes wound around
Just one slip and you tumble down
The ropes wrapped around
Just one slip and you tumble down
One slip and you tumble down
I'm goin' down, down to the market place
Goin' to learn to give
I'm goin' down, down by the sea market side
Goin' to learn to live"
Swervedriver,Rave Down,1991,shoegaze,"Rave down, hit the ground
Before the pistol crack spins me out sideways
Like the sharp hard hit of a car crash in a dream
There's kids on the corner wanna
Beat-box my brains to bits
You can't cut creed clean
Things ain't black or white like they seem
Rave down, hit the ground
Four AM all night hell gas station
Before we cruise off to the beach
Where the breeze blows easy and slow
We hung tight all night and no gig to go to
There could be something happenin' here
But there's just no place to go
Your town ain't lively up no more
Rave Down
Deep hot sun burns through the city
Yeah, they're havin' to peel
The pedestrians off the walls
Ex-cop 'round the block
Rockin' chair, suckin' beer
He blasts flies with his gun
Because swatting's no fun
Your town ain't hypin' up no more
Rave down
Rave down, hit the ground"
Swervedriver,Never Lose That Feeling,1993,shoegaze,"You can see for miles you say
I'm not watchin' anyway 
Hold on tight to the side you take 
I can't mind 'cause I'm not right 
So far reaching 
Never lose that feeling 
Past believing 
Never lose that feeling
I'll sweep up the streets today
Take your leave then look away
You need something more today
I don't mind and it's always this way
So deceiving
Never lose that feeling
So revealing
Never lose that feeling
So far reaching
Never lose that feeling
So deceiving
Never lose that feeling Feeling
Past believing
Never lose that feeling
So revealing
Never lose that feeling"
The Jesus and Mary Chain,Just Like Honey,1985,shoegaze,"Listen to the girl 
As she takes on half the world 
Moving up and so alive 
In her honey dripping beehive 
Beehive 
It's good, so good, it's so good 
So good 
Walking back to you 
Is the hardest thing that 
I can do 
That I can do for you 
For you 
I'll be your plastic toy 
I'll be your plastic toy 
For you 
Eating up the scum 
Is the hardest thing for 
Me to do

The Jesus and Mary Chain,April Skies,1987,shoegaze,"Hey honey what you trying to say
As I stand here
Don't you walk away
And the world comes tumbling down
Hand in hand in a violent life
Making love on the edge of a knife
And the world comes tumbling down
And it's hard
For me to say 
And it's hard 
For me to stay 
I'm going down 
To be by myself 
I'm going back 
For the good of my health 
And there's one thing 
I couldn't do 
Sacrifice myself to you 
Sacrifice 
Baby baby I just can't see 
Just what you mean to me 
I take my aim and I fake my words 
I'm just your long time curse 
And if you walk away 
I can't take it 
But that's the way that you are  
And that's the things that you say  
But now you've gone too far  
With all the things you say  
Get back to where you come from  
I can't help it  
Under the april skies 
Under the april skies
Under the april sun
Under the april skies
Under the april sun
Under the april sun
Under the april skies
Under the april sun
Under the april skies
Sun grows cold
Sky gets black
And you broke me up
And now you won't come back
Shaking hand, life is dead
And a broken heart
And a screaming head
Hey, hey
Under the april sky
Under the april sun
Under the april sky
Under the april sky"
The Jesus and Mary Chain,Some Candy Talking,1985,shoegaze,"I'm going down to the place tonight 
To see if I can get a taste tonight 
A taste of something warm and sweet 
That shivers your bones and rises to your heat 
I'm going down to the place tonight 
The damp and hungry place tonight 
Should all the stars shine in the sky 
They couldn't outshine your sparkling eyes 
But it's so hard to be the one 
To touch and tease and to do it all for fun 
But it's too much for a young heart to take 
Cause hearts are the easiest things you could break 
And I talk to the filth and I walk to the door 
I'm knee deep in myself 
But I want to get more of that stuff 
Of that stuff  
Some candy talking  
Talk  
And I want 
And I want 
Some candy talking 
Some candy talk 
I love the way she's walking 
I love the way she's talking 
It's just the way she's walking  
It's just the way she's talking  
And I need 
All that stuff
Give me some
Of that stuff
I want your candy. I want your candy
And I need
Give me some
Of your stuff
Give me some
I want your candy. I want your candy.
I want your candy. I want your candy.
I want stuff"
Drop Nineteens,Kick The Tragedy,1992,shoegaze,"I think it was the first time I realized that I could change the world
Or at least change the way me and my sister hit the clock on every tick just to see what happened
The time has really flown by, I guess, and it's hard to think of the way it might've been
Or remember really specifically the words and all the rest of it
I was down, more than I'll ever be, probably
That is what we do with it all together
Like the orange trees in the backyard, and it's Easter, and it just won't end
Fucking Phil, he's off on his board somewhere
And I'm just sitting here getting more and more lost with everything
That is the thing about it, it's not as if a cousin promised something and had taken it away 
It was like nobody could share my so-called dreams, which really meant none of it was happening 
And that reach around midnight left her with just about that, nothing 
There's not anything particular about it either, and I think that the whole thing gets vaguer every second 
But I am too and there's nothing wrong with that 
It's even funny when you stop to realize I'm just nineteen 
And how serious can anything be anyway? 
Not very  "
Drop Nineteens,Winona,1992,shoegaze,"There's a gap in the 20th century
And it fills the world with dreams
When you've got the looks, then the rest just works
If that's what it's like
Then hold on tight to the candy
Believe another record shop story that was born to die
It'll come on real
And we're losing time
Baby dice swingin' from a baby's hand
Too young to understand
All there is to know
To lose your soul
Alien crack down from planet car
Unhappy with their bag of stars
They search for the one
And then wrap her around the sun
They know who we are 
Could be as fast as a day that outside your door 
And it all has changed evermore, confused 
It's why I've got to know the truth 
Was it you who sang in Xanadu? 
Baby dice swingin' from a baby's hand  
Too young to understand  
All there is to know 
If you're gonna lose your soul 
Guess I've got my fate in the sky 
And I wonder why 
You'll be the one who used to go 
""I'm the only star he wants to know"" "
Drop Nineteens,Delaware,1992,shoegaze,"Welcome and spin your Hollywood
In the backyard with a friend on the telephone
The town right then is cooler than down
You're the one that turns it around
It's high and lost, forget about them 
And this sound 
Yeah, I guess this sound 
Wear a bell that Saturday makes 
If you've got what it takes 
Then fate'll come around 
Pick that wish and crying thing  
And get yourself to a super town  
Who cares who's gone?  
It's like the palm tree sickness hit home  
James Taylor's on, through this pipeline feels real good  
Flashing like rhythm, more than you could  
Imagine if it happens to you  
And ask me if it lasts  
Yesterday's home cut in half  
Good night you sleep 
It'll be a heavy drive back east "
Catherine Wheel,Black Metallic,1992,shoegaze,"I've never seen you when you're smiling

It's the colour of your skin 
Your skin is black metallic 
Your skin is black metallic 
Your skin is black metallic

Of all the secrets that you're keeping

Catherine Wheel,I Want to Touch You,1992,shoegaze,"I always thought the way you talked was neat
And I dreamed that when you speak, you speak to me

And I can't control my speech
And I'm scared that when we meet, I'll want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
You're the only soul inside that makes me shake
And the crazy, senseless things you make me take 
It would really make my day 
If you'd only move away 
'Cause I'm scared that if you stay, I'll want to touch you 
I want to touch you 
I want to touch you 
I want to touch you 
But you're always out of reach

Catherine Wheel,Crank,1993,shoegaze,"Love my superstitious games
Running circles round my brain when I'm left smiling
I love to steal this living steam
My head in someone's dream
I'm tired of sleeping
Call me crank, my idea 
Crank, so super 
Crank, my conscience clear 
I build my canopy of steel 
It fulfills my sense of real 
A chrome protection 
Call me crank, my idea 
Crank, so super 
Crank, my conscience clear 
It's clear 
In this small partition, like a prison 
Explode time bomb 
If you know where I come from 
You call me crank, my idea

Please call me crank, it's what I need

Soaked all in red  
I wish him dead

What can I do?

Sleep inside of me 
Open your gates and let the river free 
Oh kinky take me inside and let the honey slide 
I need you kinky love 
Late at night 
In my bed as I lie here 
Somewhere in limbo land 
Half awake half asleep 
Halfway somewhere else 
I know I should be sleeping 
But how can I close my eyes 
When you know I understand you're mad 
And you've got to have your kinky love 
I know I should be sleeping  
But how can I close my eyes 
When you know I understand you're mad

She looks sweet, she looks sad

Feeling so 

To where I dug myself a hole 
Pictures of her that I stle 
There's no darkness I have found 
She's all around 

She walks all over e and 
I can't take it from her
She goes where she feels to 
Only seems that she don't know 

She may come and she may go 
She may sacrifice this clone 
As the darkness has to sound 
All around 

Everytime I see Suzanne 
She looks sweet, she looks sad

Now he's gone and I'm burning all alone

Ooh, how he knocked me off my feet
Sitting by my window pane thinking am I going insane
Why do you only shoot me halfway to the moon?
And I can't get over that, over that
Baby after loving Jack there's no going back, going back
Jack and Jill they went up a hill 
To fetch a pail of water but there was a spill 
And Jill came tumbling down all alone 
Yeah, it all came tumbling down, oh no 
Pulled to the ground by gravity 
Will it remain a mystery?

It seems my hands
Are colder than yours, warm me up inside 
Your face turns red and so does mine 
And we climb all around 
You stare into my eyes 
And watch me drown inside 
You whisper to me softly as I lie
You shine so bright 
A light inside my head 
I love the thought of staring at you 
Asleep at night 
Kaleidoscopic thoughts of me and you 
And you're just so cool 
For me to see 
The life we'd have and we'd tell everyone 
Your face turns red and so does mine 
And we climb all around

And watch me drown inside 
You whisper to me softly as I lie

Are so above my way of life

And watch me drown inside
You whisper to me softly as I lie"
A Sunny Day in Glasgow,Nighttime Rainbows,2009,shoegaze,"Underneath the velvet skies, 
A quiet world that never lies, 
The stars are dancing in your eyes, 
As the moonlight paints our goodbyes. 

We chase the colors in the dark, 
A spark of light, a beating heart, 
In the stillness, we’ll embark, 
On a journey to the unknown art.

Nighttime rainbows, drifting slow, 
Through the shadows where we go,
Colors fade, but the memories glow, 
Nighttime rainbows, don’t let go. 

Whispers ride the evening breeze, 
Carried soft through the swaying trees, 
A hidden world, just you and me, 
Chasing dreams we’ll never leave.

We paint the sky with shades of hope, 
On midnight roads where we elope, 
With every dream we learn to cope, 
We find our way, we find our scope. 

Nighttime rainbows, drifting slow, 
Through the shadows where we go,
Colors fade, but the memories glow, 
Nighttime rainbows, don’t let go. 

The night is ours, no need to hide, 
The world may turn, but we will glide, 
In the quiet, side by side, 
Our hearts are where the colors collide. 

Nighttime rainbows, drifting slow, 
Through the shadows where we go, 
Colors fade, but the memories glow, 
Nighttime rainbows, don’t let go. 

As dawn begins to rise and shine, 
We’ll hold the night inside our minds, 
A fading glow, but it’s still mine, 
Nighttime rainbows, forever entwined. "

Reflected from a far..
We were but stones
Your light made us stars..

With heavy breath
Awaken regrets
Back pages and days alone
they could've been spent
Together but we were miles apart
Every inch between us
becomes light years now
No time to be void
Or save up on life
Uh you've got to spend it all

And wherever you've gone
And wherever we might go..
It don't seem fair
You seem to like it here

Wear a bell that Saturday makes 
If you've got what it takes 
Then fate'll come around 
Pick that wish and crying thing  
And get yourself to a super town

Where nothing could grow 
Was only stone and coal

Cut on the family knife

Ticks away 
Then fakes a stop 
Like every faith is a mirror above

So say I walk alone barefoot
On wicked stone tonight
Will you leap to follow?
Will you turn and go? 
Will your dreams stay rooted in the shallows? 
See the scraping sky 
Far beyond the shallows 
Far beyond the reaches of the shadows 
Though youth may fade with boyhood's cares 
New fear will catch us unaware 
I know it will, I know it will

How we've waited for moments like this.
Have Your way in this place.
Holy Spirit come do as you wish.
We are changed as You move in our midst."
M83,"	We Own the Sky",2008,shoegaze,"Each shade of blue
Is kept in our eyes
Keep blowing and lightning
Because we own the sky 
Secrets from the winds 
Burnt stars crying  
Soft, soft or cruel  
Can't we change our minds?  
We kill what we build  
Because we own the sky 
Secrets from the winds 
Burnt stars crying 
So many moons here 
Lost wings floating 
It's coming, it's coming now 
It's coming, it's coming now 
It's coming, it's coming now 
It's coming, it's coming now 
It's coming, it's coming now 
It's coming, it's coming now 
It's coming, it's coming now 
It's coming, it's coming now 
It's coming, it's coming now 
It's coming, it's coming now  "
Nothing,Guilty of Everything,2014,shoegaze,"Chasing Sundays, round and round
Blind steps off of moons, and stars are pleading
Will you catch us falling down?

And God's solutions are never found
In divinity there’s ecstasy, make love in echoes
Cling to the souls exhausted clean
Rejoice, rejection without a sound
Camouflage on open wounds, dissect your sympathies
Curtains down, come take a bow

I'll wait for you to go away again  
And I will push you far away 
I’ve given up, but you shoot anyway 
I’m guilty of everything

I'll wait for you to go away again 
And I will push you far away 
I’ve given up, but you shoot anyway 
I’m guilty of everything 

And I will push, we fall away always 
My hands are up, I’m on my knees  
I don’t have a gun, you can search me please 
I’ve given up, but you shoot anyway 
I’m guilty of everything 
I'm guilty of everything  "
"	Ringo Deathstarr",So High,2010,shoegaze,"If you want to run with me I will show you how
Beams of love are holding me, let me feel your power
If you want to suffer me I will show you how
Share a secret, you and me, come and get a smile
We're so high, I'm so high, I'm so high
Taste your sun, your lips are free I will show you how
Wish I would have dreamed of you, it's all over now
Bubblegum and ecstasy, made me feel the power
If you walk around with me I will show you how
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high"
"	Whirr",Sway,2012,shoegaze,"Don't stray, don't ever go away
I should be much too smart for this
You know it gets the better of me
Sometimes, when you and I collide
I fall into an ocean of you
Pull me out in time
Don't let me drown, let me down
I say it's all because of you
And here I go, losing my control
I'm practicing your name
So I can say it to your face
It doesn't seem right to look you in the eye
Let all the things you mean to me
Come tumbling out my mouth
Indeed, it's time tell you why
I say it's infinitely true
Say you'll stay
Don't come and go like you do
Sway my way
Yeah, I need to know all about you
And there's no cure, and no way to be sure
Why everything's turned inside out
Instilling so much doubt
It makes me so tired, I feel so uninspired
My head is battling with my heart
My logic has been torn apart
And now, it all turns sour
Come sweeten every afternoon
Say you'll stay
Don't come and go like you do
Sway my way 
Yeah, I need to know all about you 
Say you'll stay 
Don't come and go like you do 
Sway my way 
Yeah, I need to know all about you 
It's all because of you  
It's all because of you 
Now it all turns sour 
Come sweeten every afternoon 
It's time tell you why 
I say it's infinitely true 
Say you'll stay 
Don't come and go like you do 
Sway my way 
Yeah, I need to know all about you 
Say you'll stay 
Don't come and go like you do 
Sway my way 
Yeah, I need to know all about you 
It's all because of you 
It's all because of you 
It's all because of you "
